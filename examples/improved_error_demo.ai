-- Demonstration of Improved Error Messages in ai-lang
-- This file intentionally contains errors to showcase the enhanced error reporting

-- 1. Unknown Variable Error with Suggestions
-- Uncomment to see the error:
-- test1 : Nat
-- test1 = let x = 42 in let y = 17 in z

-- 2. Type Mismatch with Helpful Context  
-- Uncomment to see the error:
-- test2 : Nat -> Nat
-- test2 n = n + "hello"

-- 3. Constructor Suggestions
-- First define a simple data type
data Maybe (A : Type) : Type where
  Nothing : Maybe A
  Just : A -> Maybe A

-- Uncomment to see constructor suggestion:
-- test3 : Maybe Nat
-- test3 = Nothng  -- Typo in constructor name

-- 4. Verbose Mode Type Derivation
-- Run with -v flag to see type derivation traces
identity : {A : Type} -> A -> A
identity x = x

compose : {A : Type} -> {B : Type} -> {C : Type} -> (B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C
compose f g x = f (g x)

-- This succeeds but shows derivation steps in verbose mode
main : Nat
main = identity {Nat} 42
