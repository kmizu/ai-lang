-- Interactive greeting program

-- Main program that asks for name and greets
main : IO Unit
main = bind {Unit} {Unit}
  (putStrLn "What is your name?")
  (\_ -> bind {String} {Unit}
    getLine
    (\name -> putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")))

-- Note: ++ is string concatenation (would need to be implemented)
